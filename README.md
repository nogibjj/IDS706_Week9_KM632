# WEEK 9 Cloud-Based Notebook Project

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze the Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023) from Kaggle

## Analysis
Firstly, I took at a look at the number of billionares by gender and observed the following: 
  Male : 2303
  Female : 337 
Secondly, I wanted to know what percentage of the male and female population are self made. Following are the result. 
As we can see that there are 96 women self-made billionaires and 1716 self-made males which really surprised me. 

Thirdlt, I analyse the top 5 industries producing the highest number of billionares. Result below. 


## Conclusion 

Top Categories for Self-Made Billionaires: The top industries for self-made billionaires are Technology, Finance & Investments, Manufacturing, Fashion & Retail, and Healthcare. This suggests that these sectors offer significant opportunities for wealth creation.

Gender Disparity in Self-Made Billionaires: There is a notable gender disparity among self-made billionaires. There are 96 self-made female billionaires, which is significantly lower compared to the 1,716 self-made male billionaires. This highlights a substantial gender gap in wealth creation through entrepreneurship.

Challenges and Opportunities: The data underscores the challenges women may face in achieving self-made billionaire status compared to their male counterparts. The lower number of self-made female billionaires could be attributed to various factors, including historic gender inequalities in business and finance. However, it also presents an opportunity for promoting gender diversity and entrepreneurship among women in these high-earning industries.
